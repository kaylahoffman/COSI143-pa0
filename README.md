# Programming Assignment 0: EDA on Housing Data 


In this assignment you will build a notebook that explores various housing data. The data set you will be using is on GitHub. The assignment is similar to the  "RealDirect Data Strategy" Exercice at the end of Chapter 2 in the "Doing Data Science" book in case you are interested to read more about it. 

In this programming assignment you will:

* Load and prepare a collected set of data for analysis
* Create  plots that helps make sense of the data
* Formulate conclussions based on findings

Please keep in mind that this assignment is open-ended when deciding which plot to build and the conclussions you draw. 

## Part 1: Load and Clean your data [20 points]

* First you need to load your data set. Start with the Manhattan data. Your data is available on GitHub. 

* Print the top 5  your dataset as well as the data types of the attributes of the data set. 

* Clean the sale price attribute to include only numeric values and convert it to numeric type (currently it has the symbol '$' which makes it of string type)

* Convert the type of the land square feet and the gross square feet attributes to be numeric.

## Part 2: Explore the Manhattan data set [35 points]

* Print a histogram of the sales price data
* Remove all zero sale price values and replot the histogram in log scale 
* Use a scatter plot to demonstrate the relationship between sale price (y axis) and gross square feet (x -axis)
* Generate a subset that includes data for 1-, 2- and 3-family homes (this is specified in the BUILDING CLASS CATEGORY attribute) 
* Use a scatter plot to demonstrate the relationship between sale price (y axis) and gross square feet for the above subset. 

## Part 3: EDA on new data sets [45 points]

* Repeat your EDA for two different data sets are available on GitHub under the *extra data sets* folder (20 points for each dataset)
* What are your conclussions when comparing the plots of the different data sets?  (5 points)
